Izzle Support Library and Classes

1) Installing
-------------

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As IO Izzle uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `install` command to generate a new ICS application:

    php composer.phar install

Composer will install Izzle IO and all its dependencies under the specified directory.
